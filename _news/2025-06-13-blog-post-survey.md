  ### Shaping Anonymous Support - Your Input Matters!
  
  Many people avoid therapy or digital health services because they fear being judged or excluded due to sensitive personal characteristics. At the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, we   are addressing this challenge through the VERANDA research project which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space.

  Our mission is to develop **safe and anonymous access to digital health support such as psychotherapy – especially for individuals who currently avoid such services due to fear of stigmatization**.

### Why Your Opinion Matters

To better understand these needs, we are conducting an online survey. Your input will directly influence how we shape future digital solutions – especially tools for anonymous online therapy sessions.
- Duration: 30 - 45 minutes  
- Completely anonymous – no personal data will be collected  
- Open to multiple groups listed below

---
### Eligibility Criteria:

- Be at least **18 years old**
- Speak fluent **German or English**

### Survey Links by Group

The inclusion of these diverse groups reflects the various ways in which stigma can create barriers to digital mental health access. We are not suggesting that these groups are equivalent or comparable. However, all are affected by stigma in ways that can limit access to mental health care. We aim to understand the very different forms of stigma each group faces — and to ensure that all perspectives are valued and represented in the development of safer, more inclusive technologies.
